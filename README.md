# Portfolio Risk Analyzer
## CP317 - Term Project
### Created by: Abdullah Wasiq, Zohaib Ali, Maaz Ahmed, Rayyan Ahmed, Parth Bhatt

This project aims to develop a web-based portfolio risk analyzer tool that helps individual investors (specifically amateur) evaluate the risk of their stock investments. The system will accept the user’s portfolio data, like stock symbols, quantities, and purchase dates, then calculate financial risk metrics including volatility, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, and diversification index. The results will be presented in a user-friendly dashboard to support better investment decisions, help users learn more about what they’re doing while they invest, and ultimately provide a better experience navigating the stock market.
